Yellow page idk. maybe this will be like a phone book, but for components I like. Plus stuff to help me make that junior to mid jump as a software dev. 



NEED TODOS:

1. pass profile information in as props
2. grab other components from tailwind flex then alter them 
3. use react aria, zustard, zod, atoms by jotai, and tanstack router and query.
4. check out anime.js and https://www.reactbits.dev/

inside /components/examples/ create example files using react aria, zustard, zod, atoms by jotai, and tanstack query
/src/main.jsx any global state contexts will wrap the app in this file.

className naming: <div className="Navbar (tailwind styles)">

commenting: // element/function name: purpsose(at most 2 sentences if needed)
Only put a comment above the function/element
