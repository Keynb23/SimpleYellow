Yellow page idk. maybe this will be like a phone book, but for components I like. Plus stuff to help me make that junior to mid jump as a software dev. 



NEED TODOS:

1. pass profile information in as props
2. grab other components from tailwind flex then alter them 
3. use react aria, zustard, zod, atoms by jotai, and tanstack router and query.
4. check out anime.js and https://www.reactbits.dev/
